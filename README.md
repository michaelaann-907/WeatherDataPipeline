# WeatherDataPipeline



This project implements a data pipeline for collecting, processing, storing, and visualizing weather data from various sources. Using Python, the pipeline fetches data from the OpenWeatherMap API, cleans and transforms it with pandas, stores it in MongoDB, and visualizes the data using Matplotlib. The pipeline is automated with cron jobs to ensure regular updates. Ideal for anyone interested in building a scalable weather data collection and analysis system.
